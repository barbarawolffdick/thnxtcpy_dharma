Once The Next Company supports new startups, we suggest you keep working on your studies and plans and come back when you are already running your company. We would love to look at all desks and presentations, but we don’t have staff for that, so we ask you to come back later when you’ve started your company. There are several good articles on how to move in the start, this one from Inc is especially simple and to the point.

    (I’m done) We are looking for disruptive ideas but there are lots of interesting incremental innovation companies that we are interested too. Let’s see what your company is. We’ll take a look at what you have said about {{ companyName }} – hope you were not way to optimistic of your own project – in that case we will not select your company – and come back to you in a while – don’t expect less then a few weeks return from us, there are lots of people talking to us – with the next steps. We’re expecting crazy stuff to do together and great business opportunities to explore! Talk to you soon!<br>
